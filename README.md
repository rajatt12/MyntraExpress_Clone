## Project Overview  
This project is a clean front-end clone of the Myntra “Express” shopping experience — focusing solely on HTML and CSS (no framework, no back-end). It includes the homepage layout: navigation header, hero/banner, featured categories, product grid and footer.  
The goal is to provide a solid static frontend base that can later be upgraded (with JavaScript, frameworks, API integration) when you choose.

## Features  
- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
- Header with logo, navigation links (Men, Women, Kids), search bar, cart/wishlist icons  
- Banner/hero section for promotional content  
- Featured categories section (with image tiles)  
- Product listing grid (cards showing image, name, price)  
- Footer with company links, social icons, copyright  

## Folder & File Structure  
* Myntra_Express.html - main HTML page integrated with CSS
